# SimScale PrimeGenerator REST API

### Problem Statement

Using the code from part 1 as the generation engine, write a server application (also in Java/Scala/Go)giving the user the chance to use your prime number generator over a REST API over HTTP (API frameworks/libraries are allowed and encouraged).

### How to run

1. Make sure `jdk 8+` and `maven` are installed.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `mvn package` to generate a fat jar.
4. Run the generated jar `java -jar PATH_TO_JAR` to start the server.
5. Modify the `.env` file to meet your environment and preferences.

**Compiled fat jar is also available in the releases section**.
